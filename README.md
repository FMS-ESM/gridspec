Mosaic

This repository contains a fork of the GFDL [gridspec](http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/~vb/grids/gridspec-tools.html) programs, with modifications to allow compilation using make outside of `GFDL` with `gcc`.

The code can be compiled from the _scripts_ directory using `./compile.csh`. Some testing of the code can be performed using `test.csh` in the same directory.
